**TaleTrip: A Voice First Game** </br>
Choose one interactive adventure from the app's long list and play it whenever and wherever you want. </br>
Thanks to TaleTrip's voice recognition's features and ability to read you the story, everything is possible. </br>
These optional features make the game also very accessible to everyone. Connect your phone to your car and play with your family during a roadtrip, use your headphones while on the subway and use the in-story buttons instead of your voice; have fun as
you prefer. </br>
** We shape the story, you shape the outcome. **
